# Teleops-Kit
A TeleOps Kit (Teleoperation Kit) is a set of tools, software, or hardware designed to enable remote control and monitoring of robots, drones, industrial machinery, or other systems. It often includes interfaces for real-time communication, sensor data streaming, and command execution. Below is a breakdown of what a TeleOps Kit typically involves and how to set up a GitHub repository for one
